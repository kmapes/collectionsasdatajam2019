Experiments with World Digital Library in ACH Collections as Data Jam 2019 in Pittsburgh, PA

At the ACH Conference in Pittsburgh, PA, July 23, 2019, at the Collections as Data Jam workshop. The team included: Kristen Mapes, Mickey Casad, David Newbury, Ellen Prokop, Anindita Basu Sempere, and Ece Turnator. We explored the World Digital Library (https://www.wdl.org/en/), and used its API (http://api.wdl.org/) to undertake a data exploration of a search for "dragon" in the library. The csv included here is the compiled data we created, which includes latitude and longitude, dates, subject headings, and image measurements (hue, saturation, brightness). The pdf is a slideshow with many screenshots of the work we did, including a data model of the process, and Palladio visualizations.

The tools we used were:
- Palladio
- Vistorian (well, we tried)
- Carto
- Image measurements - ImageJ (& Imageplot in some ways)
- RAW Graphs
- IIIF
- node-microdata-scraper
- Typhoeus
